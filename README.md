# To-Do List, Final Version

This is a minimalist to-do list web app currently deployed on Heroku [here](https://enigmatic-peak-88936.herokuapp.com/).

- Front-end: EJS
- Back-end: Node
- Database: Mongo Atlas

**What I enjoyed about building this app:** I really enjoyed using Mongoose and integrating a Mongo DB to create an app that persists data over time. It's was also really cool to use EJS to build new pages using URL creation. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:**: I had some system issues when integrating Mongoose initially, but once I read the documentation and trouble-shot, everything went really well. 

**What I learned while building this app:** Integrating a database seems to be one of the most essential components of building a successful website, and I really like learning about how to include databases and persist data. 

(currently working on replicating this idea with React -- CodeSandbox [here](https://dwy00q.csb.app/))
